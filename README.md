This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

Mobile Flashcards is a react native application designed either for the iOS or Android platforms. This application allows users to store flashcards by decks and then quiz themselves on each of those decks. Users can quiz themselves as many times as they wish.

## The following are instructions for deploying the application
